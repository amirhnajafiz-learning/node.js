# :closed_lock_with_key: safex

Safex is a program designed to create a secure environment, known as a sandbox, for applications. It redirects any file writing operations made by the applications to the `/tmp` directory. Additionally, Safex monitors file access and blocks any attempts by the application to access files listed in the `~/.safenoread` file.

## Compilation and Usage

To compile and use the Safex program, open a terminal and run the `make` command. This will generate the `safex` executable. You can then use this executable to sandbox an application. For example, to run the text editor Gedit with the sandboxing feature, you would enter the following command:

```
./safex gedit myfile
```

After running the application, you can check the `/tmp` directory for files that have been redirected, which will be named in the format `safex.XXRTFSE`.

## Implementation Details

Safex utilizes the `ptrace` system call to monitor the processes it is controlling. In the `main.c` file (specifically lines 91â€“110), a new process is created to run the specified application, while the parent process is responsible for tracing this child process. On line 104, options are set to monitor `fork`, `vfork`, and `clone` operations.

```c
if (ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, child, 0, PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD | PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK | PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK | PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE) == -1) {
    perror("ptrace SETOPTIONS failed");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

The program then calls the `trace_process` function, passing the child process's PID to monitor its system calls. Within the `trace_process` function, system calls are tracked using:

```c
ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL, initial_pid, 0, 0);
```

A loop is used to extract the system calls and invoke a function called `handle_syscall` to monitor the `open`, `openat`, and `write` system calls.

To trace child processes, the program examines events triggered during system calls. Since the event type is contained in the top 16 bits, it shifts the bits to identify the event and checks for any `fork`, `vfork`, or `clone` events. If such an event occurs, the program calls `ptrace` on the newly created child process.

Next, the program checks if the filename exists in the `.safenoread` file. If it does not, the program examines the flags for `(flags & O_WRONLY) || (flags & O_RDWR)`, indicating a write operation. If a write operation is detected, the program creates a temporary file and replaces the original filename.

A custom structure called `FileMap` is defined to store the original filenames along with their corresponding temporary redirects. This structure has a default limit of 10,000 entries, which can be increased in `helpers.h`.

```c
// Structure to track original files and their redirects
struct FileMap {
    char original_filename[PATH_MAX];
    char tmp_filename[PATH_MAX];
};
```

This mapping is used to ensure that multiple accesses to the same file are redirected to the correct temporary file.

## Safenoread file

The `~/.safenoread` file is located using the `HOME` environment variable. If the `.safenoread` file is not in your home directory, you should update its path in `helpers.h`. For example, if it is located in `home/username/Desktop/.safenoread`, set `SAFENOREAD_PATH` to `Desktop/.safenoread`.

Make sure that the file paths specified in `.safenoread` are absolute paths to correctly filter the intended files.

## Testing

To test the functionality of Safex, run the command `make test`. This will use sample applications located in the `bin` directory to verify that Safex operates as expected.
